## Memory

Use the `headroom_memory` MCP server for persistent cross-session knowledge.

**Before** answering questions about prior decisions, conventions, project context,
architecture, user preferences, org info, codenames, debugging history, or anything
from past sessions — call `memory_search` first.

**After** making durable decisions, discovering conventions, or learning important
facts — call `memory_save` to persist them for future sessions.

Memory is your first source of truth for anything not visible in the current conversation.
